<p align="center"><b>Russians against war</b></p>

We are the initiative group of Russians against the Vladimir Putin’s fascist regime in Russia and its actions. We are supporting the freedom and democracy in Russia.

Decisions made by Putin have seriously violated and violating the international laws. The most significant examples are Russo-Georgian War in 2008, provoked by Russia; Annexation of Crimea in 2014, support of separatist movement in South-Eastern territories of Ukraine, which resulted the prolonged war in Donbass.

On 24th February 2022, Putin has unleashed the criminal war against the sovereign state, Ukraine, alleging contrived and cynical causes. War in Ukraine has already resulted the death of tens of thousands of people and devastation of many cities. More than 10,000 Ukrainians had to leave their home. Many of them are illegally deported to Russia, often without proper documents and money. Among the deportees there are children, left without their parents.

In Russia, War in Ukraine is shamefully called as “Special operation for defense of Russian-speaking population in Ukraine” Russians, who are not agreeing with it are arrested, for just they are calling this war as “war”, for they are protesting and speaking “No to War”, “No to Fascism”. From the beginning of war in Ukraine, more than 15,000 people are detained in Russia, and this number is growing, even now.

Freedom of speech does not exist under the Putin, and practically all dissident media have to leave Russia or cease their activities. Russia under Putin has become dictatorial regime and the country, where the politicians and journalists, even ordinary people can be jailed or poisoned, even can be killed. The most well-known cases to the world citizens are the assassinations of A. Litvinenko, A. Politkovskaya, A. Baburova, B. Nemtsov, poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, V. Kara-Murza and A. Navalny.

We regard those actions of Vladimir Putin are criminal and inhumane. The repressive fascist regime has created by his hands.
